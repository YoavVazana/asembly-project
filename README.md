Project Description: Custom Assembler for System Programming

As part of the "System Programming Laboratory" course at the Open University, I developed a custom assembler in C programming language. This project involved processing files written in a specific programming language designed by the university for the task. The assembler performs several key functions:

Parsing Instructions: The assembler reads input files containing instructions and directives written in the university's custom machine language.
Encryption and Object Code Generation: It encrypts the instructions and generates object files with machine code instructions based on the received input.
Variable Usage Tracking: The assembler generates an extern file that indicates which lines in the input files used variables defined in another file. This tracking helps manage variable usage across the project.
Entry Variable Definition: It creates an entry file that specifies where entry variables were defined, allowing for their usage in other files.
Error Handling: The assembler checks for errors during processing. If errors are found, it prints the error message along with the line number where the error occurred. Files with errors are not exported, ensuring the integrity of the output.
This project showcases my ability to work with low-level programming concepts, file processing, encryption techniques, error handling, and project management within the context of system programming. It reflects my commitment to learning and applying advanced programming skills in practical projects.
